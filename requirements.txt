# ------------------------------Hereâ€™s a brief description of each of the libraries you listed:--------------------------------

# TensorFlow - For building and training deep learning models.


# OpenCV-Python - For image processing and computer vision tasks.

# NumPy - For numerical operations and data manipulation.

# Matplotlib - For visualizing detection results and performance metrics.

# Albumentations - For image augmentation to enhance model robustness.

# Pandas - For data manipulation and handling structured data, such as annotations or CSV files.

# Scikit-learn - For model evaluation and performance metrics (e.g., confusion matrix, classification reports).

# Tqdm - For adding progress bars to loops during training or data processing.

# PyYAML - For configuration management if you're using YAML files for model parameters or settings.

# Flask or FastAPI - For building a web interface if you plan to deploy the application.
